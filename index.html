                <p class="intro_paragraph"> Okay so HIII what's upppp. You thought I wasn't gonna get you anything huh? Well you're kinda right cause this isn't anything really lol. But I try. I know I can't get you an actual present cause you're too far away, and sending you money would probably not be a good idea. Soo I'm gonna do one of the only things I know how to do. I made this so you could always come back and look at it. As like a digital souvenir, something you can read that might make you smile lol. To me that would be better than anything else I could get you. So I hope you really enjoyed you birthday and many days to come, and I hope this might remind you of me a bit and by extension our dynamic. NO THIS ISN'T JUST BESIDE I COULDN'T GET YOU ANYTHING ELSE. I really wanted to do this since last year lol. So keep on reading. Have fun on your visit here, enjoy Miyo (ᓚᘏᗢ). </p>

		I have no idea what you're talking about. If there is anything
